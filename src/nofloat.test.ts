/**
 * The source scan: **no rate may pass through a float.**
 *
 * This is a test about text rather than behaviour, deliberately. The defect it guards against is
 * not one wrong answer that a unit test could pin down — it is a habit. `Math.floor(usd * 1e6)`
 * at `repos/forge-pay/services/pay/src/pricing.ts:64` and `Number(scaled) / Number(RATE_SCALE)`
 * at `:453` are both individually plausible-looking lines that quietly put the estate's exchange
 * rates through a double. A behavioural test only catches them on the inputs it happens to try;
 * the scan catches them the moment they are written.
 *
 * The scan reads the shipped sources only. Test files are excluded because they legitimately
 * demonstrate the float arithmetic being avoided — `rates.test.ts` computes
 * `Math.floor(0.07 * 1e6)` precisely to show that it is wrong.
