/**
 * One refresh round.
 *
 * The shape is carried forward from `repos/forge-pay/services/pay/src/pricing.ts:190`, which gets
 * the important things right: settle every source independently, require a minimum count, reject
 * the round on divergence, take the median. What changes:
 *
 *   1. **`Promise.allSettled`, not `Promise.all` over try/catch.** The old file wraps each fetch in
 *      a try and returns an empty map on failure, which works but hides the distinction between
 *      "answered with nothing" and "threw" — and the reason a source failed is exactly what an
 *      operator needs when three of four are down.
 *   2. **The result lands in a table, not a Map.** See `quotes.ts`.
 *   3. **A round runs once for the estate**, under the `price.refresh` / `global` lease, rather
 *      than once per replica on a `setInterval` (`pricing.ts:479`). N replicas on a timer is N
 *      times the exchange rate-limit consumption and N different answers.
 *   4. **Never a float.** Sources yield decimal strings and `parseScaled` reads their digits.
