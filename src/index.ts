/**
 * The composition root.
 *
 * Everything this service is made of is constructed here, once, in an order that is not arbitrary.
 * Each step below carries the reason it must precede the next; the ordering is the substance of
 * this file, and getting it wrong reproduces a defect the estate already has.
 *
 * What this file deliberately does **not** do: run migrations. That is `src/migrator.ts`, a
 * separate one-shot process. See AD-17 and rule 7.
 *
 * What it also does not do is start a timer. The estate's oracle calls
 * `setInterval(tick, refreshSeconds * 1000)` at the end of its own startup, which is why N
 * replicas produce N rounds and N different medians. Here the refresh is seeded into the job table
 * and claimed under a lease — see `src/jobs.ts`.
 *
 * Traces are exported by the OpenTelemetry SDK loaded ahead of this module —
 * `NODE_OPTIONS=--import @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node/register` in the deploy, which
 * reads `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and friends from the environment itself. That is why no
 * `OTEL_*` variable appears in `src/env.ts`: the service does not read them, so under rule 9 it
 * must not declare them.
