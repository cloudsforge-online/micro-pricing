/**
 * Background work.
 *
 * Rule 8 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: every background timer is a leased job. There is no
 * `setInterval` in this repository doing domain work, and adding one fails review.
 *
 * **This service is the clearest case for that rule in the estate.** The oracle it replaces runs
 * `setInterval(tick, env.oracleRefreshSeconds * 1000)` at `pricing.ts:479`, guarded by nothing at
 * all. With three replicas that is three refresh rounds a minute against four exchanges — three
 * times the rate-limit consumption, and three different medians written to three different Maps,
 * so which rate a user is quoted depends on which replica the balancer picked.
 *
 * **The lease key names the contended resource, not the row.** Ask: what would break if two of
 * these ran at once? Whatever the answer names, that is the key.
 *
 *   | Work          | Key      | What two at once would break                                    |
 *   |---------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
 *   | outbox.relay  | `stream` | The outbox stream. Two relays deliver one batch twice.          |
 *   | price.refresh | `global` | The quote set, which is one set for the whole estate. Keying on |
 *   |               |          | the asset instead would let four rounds run concurrently, each  |
 *   |               |          | making its own request to every exchange for every asset, and   |
 *   |               |          | the rate-limit rejection that follows would take out the source |
 *   |               |          | count for all of them at once. `global` is also the key         |
 *   |               |          | docs/ecosystem records for `price.refresh` in the jobs package. |
