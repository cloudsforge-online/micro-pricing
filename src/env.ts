 * Configuration, validated at import.

 * Rule 9 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2 — "a repo declares the variables it needs; the deploy provides
 * exactly those" — is a property of this file. Every variable the service reads is named here and
 * nowhere else, so the deploy manifest can be derived from it and `env_file: .env` fan-out (which
 * hands every container the whole estate's secrets) has nothing to justify it.
 *
 * Two behaviours are copied deliberately from the estate's custody service, which is the only
 * place that gets this right today:
 *
 *   1. **A missing variable names itself.** `undefined` propagating into a connection string
 *      surfaces four layers later as an unreadable driver error.
 *   2. **A known placeholder is refused outright.** A default secret in source is not convenient,
 *      it is catastrophic.

 * list of exact strings and anything under 24 characters, and the value that sat on 54 lines of a
 * PUBLIC compose
 * file — `estate-only-outbox-secret-00000000000000` — was on no list and was 40 characters, so it
 * passed every service in the estate (micro-org #142). A check that could not fail read as the
 * absence of a problem, and it was live on 44 containers across both networks.
 *
 * `assertGeneratedSecret` asserts what a placeholder cannot have: the base64 or hex alphabet (no
 * hyphens — every placeholder this estate wrote had one), 32 decoded BYTES rather than 24
 * keystrokes, and a measured Shannon entropy floor. It has no NODE_ENV exemption and no escape
 * hatch, so CI generates a real value per run rather than being let through.
 *
 * `required` in front of it and nothing else, deliberately: the deleted checks were a strict subset of
 * the stronger ones, and running them first would answer a 40-character placeholder with "must be
 * at least 24 characters" — a message that is true, useless, and points the operator at the wrong
