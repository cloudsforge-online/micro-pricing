 *
 * Carried forward from `repos/forge-pay/services/pay/src/pricing.ts` — the endpoints, the
 * Kraken legacy-asset-name mapping and the note about Binance quoting in USDT are all its work and
 * all correct. Three things change:
 *
 *   1. **A source yields decimal STRINGS, never numbers.** The old file returned
 *      `Partial<Record<MarketCoin, number>>` and converted with `Math.floor(usd * 1e6)`, so every
 *      quote had been through a double twice before the median saw it. See `rates.ts`.
 *   2. **Fetching is injected.** `marketSources` takes its transport, so the whole oracle can be
 *      driven from a fake in tests — no test in this repository touches a live exchange, which is
 *      what makes the divergence and staleness rules testable at all rather than aspirational.
 *   3. **A source's failure is its own.** `Promise.allSettled` in `oracle.ts` means one exchange
 *      being down costs one source, not the round.

 * WHICH SYMBOL EACH VENUE KNOWS AN ASSET BY — four maps, and NOT four hardcoded URLs.
 *
 * These used to be three literal query strings with the assets spelled into them, next to two
 * lookup maps. That arrangement had a failure mode that is worth naming, because it very nearly
 * happened here and it takes the whole oracle down rather than one asset:
 *
 *   `MARKET_ASSETS` is DERIVED — `rates.ts` filters `ON_CHAIN_ASSETS` — so adding an asset to
 *   the chain contract in another repository silently widened the loops below WITHOUT widening the
 *   URLs. CoinGecko, Kraken and Binance would then have quoted four assets out of five and the
 *   fifth would simply be absent, which is survivable. **Coinbase would not.** It builds one URL
 *   per member from the asset code itself, `Promise.all` rejects on the first rejection, and
 *   `httpFetchJson` throws on any non-200 — so a single unlisted symbol turns a 404 into a source
 *   that answered nothing, and `oracle.ts` then counts coinbase out for BTC, ETH, SOL and XRP
 *   as well. One new asset, four assets' quotes gone, on a live estate.
 *
 * So no venue is ever asked for a symbol it has not been told this venue publishes. An asset with
 * no entry here is simply not requested, and is therefore absent from that source's answer — the
 * outcome `collect` and `decideRound` were already built to handle, per asset, failing closed.
 * `sources.test.ts` asserts every `MARKET_ASSETS` member appears in all four maps, so wiring an
 * asset into the chain contract without a price source is a red test rather than an outage.
 *
 * Reject-on-first-failure inside a source is UNCHANGED and still correct: a partial answer from one
 * venue is still one opinion, and the round's minimum-source rule decides whether losing it
 * matters. What changed is that a missing symbol can no longer manufacture that failure.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

/* ── DOGE AND ETC ARE WIRED HERE BEFORE THEY EXIST AS ASSET CODES, AND THAT IS THE ORDERING ────
 *
 * `contracts/packages/chain/src/index.ts`, above `ON_CHAIN_ASSETS`, states the rule this file is
 * the other half of: "wire the follower, the addresses and the sweep; add the price source and
 * prove it against the live venues; THEN add the member". LTC is the worked example. So the five
 * maps below carry `DOGE` and `ETC` while `AssetCode` still has neither, and every entry is inert
 * until the chain contract widens — `quoted()` intersects with `MARKET_ASSETS`, which is derived
 * from `ON_CHAIN_ASSETS`, so a symbol for an asset the estate cannot yet name is never requested.
 *
 * **The keys typecheck today and the lookups do not, and the difference is worth knowing before
 * anyone tries to "fix" the cast in `sources.test.ts`.** The maps are `Partial<Record<AssetCode,
 * …>>`, so `COINGECKO_IDS['DOGE']` is a TS7053 against a union that does not contain `DOGE`.
 * Writing `DOGE:` INSIDE the literal is accepted only because the literal is passed to
 * `Object.freeze` first, which loses its freshness and with it the excess-property check. That is
 * a quirk being relied on deliberately for one release, not a claim that the union is irrelevant:
 * the moment micro-contracts merges, both halves are ordinary.

 *
 * DOGE IS NOT, AND GUESSING IT FROM ETC'S SHAPE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED A KEY THAT DOES NOT EXIST.
 * Kraken answers under `XDGUSD` — one X, no `Z`, and NOT `XXDGZUSD`, which is a hard error:
 *
 *   $ curl -s 'https://api.kraken.com/0/public/Ticker?pair=XDGUSD'
 *   {"error":[],"result":{"XDGUSD":{"a":["0.070960700",…],…,"c":["0.070960600","14148.69660064"],…}}}

 *   $ curl -s 'https://api.kraken.com/0/public/Ticker?pair=XXDGZUSD'
 *   {"error":["EQuery:Unknown asset pair"]}
 *
 * `/0/public/AssetPairs?pair=XDGUSD,ETCUSD` explains the asymmetry and is why the two entries below
 * do not rhyme: DOGE's pair record is `{"altname":"XDGUSD","base":"XXDG","quote":"ZUSD"}` while
 * ETC's is `{"altname":"ETCUSD","base":"XETC","quote":"ZUSD"}`. Both bases carry the legacy `X`,
 * but the CANONICAL PAIR NAME — which is what the ticker keys its result by — kept the prefixed
 * form only for ETC. The response key is a fact about each pair, never a rule about the venue.
 *
 * `DOGEUSD` is DOGE's fallback rather than a second legacy spelling: it is the name Kraken would
 * land on if it ever finishes the migration, and it already resolves as a request today.
