/**
 * **THE SIGNATURE WAS RIGHT AND THE ENVELOPE WAS NOT.**
 *
 * `@cloudsforge/contracts-events` types the wire version as "major.minor" — a STRING — and this
 * relay stamped the stored INTEGER. A delivery that verified was still discarded at the envelope
 * before any consumer read a payload. Eight relays did this at once and every suite in the estate
 * stayed green, because each one declared its OWN `EventEnvelope` and no compiler ever compared
 * the two.
 *
 * Measured with the contract's own `classifyEnvelope` against `STORED_ROW` on 2026-08-11:
 *
 *      as shipped -> malformed: version: missing, actor: missing, correlationId: missing
 *     fixed      -> well-formed; only the registration is outstanding
 *
 * The verdict is taken from the CONTRACT'S OWN classifier, never from a shape restated here. A
 * local copy of the rule agrees with a wrong implementation instead of catching it, which is the
 * mistake that produced the defect in the first place.
 *
 * MUTATIONS THIS KILLS — each one applied to `buildEnvelope` and each one confirmed red:
 *   - `version: row.version`, the stored integer, which is what shipped: `classifyEnvelope`
 *     answers `version: missing` and the defect assertion fails.
 *   - `version: String(row.version)` — a string, but "1" rather than "1.0": the shape assertion
 *     fails, so widening the fix to "any string" does not survive either.
 *   - `actor: row.actor` / `correlationId: row.correlation_id`, the nullable columns passed
 *     straight through, which is the other half of what the estate measured above.
