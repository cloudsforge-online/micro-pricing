/**
 * Shared setup for the database tests, and the fake-source harness.
 *
 * **A database test runs only against a database whose name says it is a test database.** That is
 * not a convenience: `resetPricing` truncates every table in the schema, and requiring "test" in
 * the name is the difference between a red build and an emptied environment.
 *
 * **No test in this repository touches a live exchange.** `fixedSource` and `failingSource` below
 * are the whole transport for every oracle test: a suite that reached CoinGecko would be a suite
 * that fails when CoinGecko rate-limits it, that cannot reproduce a divergence, and that cannot
 * test the fail-closed staleness rule at all because it has no control over the price it is given.
 *
 * Not a test file itself — it is excluded from the build and contains no `test()` call.
