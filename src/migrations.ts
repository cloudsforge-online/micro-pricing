/**
 * The versioned schema.
 *
 * Rule 7 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2: versioned files, run by a one-shot job under an advisory lock,
 * expand/contract only. Nothing here is executed by `index.ts` — `src/migrator.ts` is the only
 * caller, and the service asserts the version rather than reaching it.
 *
 * **A released migration is immutable.** `@cloudsforge/db` checksums each one and refuses a run
 * where the text changed after it was applied, because two databases would then disagree about
 * what "version 4" means. The fix for a wrong migration is always a new migration.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **`price_quotes` is the defect this service exists to fix.**
 *
 * `repos/forge-pay/services/pay/src/pricing.ts:60` holds the quote set in a module-level
 * `Map<DepositCoin, Quote>`. A Map is per-process, so with more than one replica:
 *
 *   - each replica refreshes on its own `setInterval` and holds its own median, so two replicas
 *     quote different rates for the same second and a user can shop between them;
 *   - `PUT /admin/prices/:asset` reaches exactly one replica, so an administered EMBER price is
 *     applied by that replica and ignored by every other one — the read-through cache at
 *     `pricing.ts:253` makes this worse, not better, because it is also per-process;
 *   - a restart empties the Map, so a fresh replica serves "no quote yet" until its first round.
 *
 * Moving the quote to a table makes the estate quote one rate, makes an admin price update
 * estate-wide and atomic, and lets the refresh run once under a lease instead of N times.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
