/**
 * The quote store and the rate a caller may settle against.
 *
 * The staleness cases carry the most weight here. A stale quote is not a discount, it is an
 * unknown price, and the estate's oracle is one `if` away from serving one — the same rule exists
 * at `repos/forge-pay/services/pay/src/pricing.ts`, and it is right, but it protects a value
 * that only one replica has. Here the rule protects a value the whole estate shares.
