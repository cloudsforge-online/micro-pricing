/**
 * The four price sources — which, until this file existed, had no test at all.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THIS IS THE FILE THAT MAKES WIDENING THE ASSET SET SAFE, AND IT IS WORTH SAYING WHY.
 *
 * `MARKET_ASSETS` is not a list in this repository. `rates.ts` derives it from `ON_CHAIN_ASSETS`
 * in `@cloudsforge/contracts-chain`, which lives in another repository and is compiled into 27+
 * services. So an edit over there widens the loops in `sources.ts` here, in a deploy that need not
 * mention pricing at all.
 *
 * Before this file, that edit would have taken the oracle down for every asset. `sources.ts` asked
 * Coinbase for `https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/<CODE>-USD/spot` built from the asset code
 * itself; `httpFetchJson` throws on any non-200; `Promise.all` rejects on the first rejection. A
 * single unlisted symbol therefore turned into "coinbase answered nothing", and `oracle.ts`
 * counts a source's whole promise, so BTC, ETH, SOL and XRP each lost a vote too. With
 * `PRICING_MIN_SOURCES` at its default that is not a degradation, it is a rejected round.
 *
 * Two things now stand between that edit and an outage, and the first is the one that matters:
 *
 *   1. **No venue is ever asked for a symbol it has not been told the venue publishes.** An
 *      unmapped asset is skipped, so the worst case is one asset absent from one source — which is
 *      what `collect` and `decideRound` were always built for.
 *   2. **`every market asset is quotable by every source` below goes red** the moment the chain
 *      contract widens without the maps widening with it. Red on a branch, not amber at 3am.
 *
 * No test here touches a live exchange; the transport is injected. The five symbols were checked
 * against the live endpoints once, by hand, on 2026-08-05, and that check is recorded in the
 * comments on the maps rather than run in CI — a suite that hits four exchanges is a suite that
 * fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the code.

 * entirely by a merge in micro-contracts, which is precisely the cross-repo surprise the maps in
 * `sources.ts` were built to stop. The fixture has to widen with them, in the same PR.
 *
 * The two new numbers are the live mid-prices measured on 2026-08-08 (recorded verbatim on the
